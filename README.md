# multigrid

We use multigrid method to solve a two dimensional Poisson Equation.

Although in two dimensions, MATLAB's backslash linear systems solver is superior in most cases, multigrid wins out once we turn to three dimensions. 

So this 2 dimensional solver is to demonstrate the convergence properties guarenteed by theory on a 'model' problem.
